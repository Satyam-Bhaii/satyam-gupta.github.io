                            I'm <strong>Satyam Gupta</strong>, but most people know me as <strong class="gradient-text">Satyam Bhaii</strong>. 
                            I'm a passionate developer from the spiritual tech-hub of <strong>Haridwar, India</strong>, 
                            specializing in building robust infrastructure for the Minecraft ecosystem.

                        <p>
                            My journey started with a simple Minecraft server and evolved into creating 
                            enterprise-grade hosting solutions through <strong>SenCiHost</strong>. Today, I focus on 
                            high-performance server architecture, custom launcher development, and creating 
                            intuitive user interfaces.

                        <p>
                            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to 
                            open-source projects, or helping the gaming community at <strong>PluginsHub.in</strong>.
